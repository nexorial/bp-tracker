Task: 开发血压记录工具 BP Tracker
Started: 2026-02-14 12:12 PM

## Codebase Patterns
- This project uses Next.js 15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing
- SQLite (better-sqlite3) for database
- TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- Tests are excluded from typecheck via tsconfig.json
- Database files (.db) are gitignored

## 2026-02-14 12:30 PM - US-001: Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Installed dependencies: recharts, better-sqlite3, @types/better-sqlite3
- Configured Jest with React Testing Library for testing
- Created smoke tests to verify project setup
- Updated page.tsx with Tailwind test element
- Typecheck passes
- Tests pass (3/3)

**Learnings:**
- Need to exclude __tests__ directory from tsconfig.json for typecheck
- jest-environment-jsdom is required separately as of Jest 28
- Project structure follows Next.js 15 App Router conventions

## 2026-02-14 12:23 PM - US-002: Create SQLite database schema for BP records
- Created db/ directory for database files
- Created db/schema.sql with bp_records table:
  - id (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)
  - systolic (INTEGER NOT NULL)
  - diastolic (INTEGER NOT NULL)
  - heart_rate (INTEGER NOT NULL)
  - recorded_at (DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
  - notes (TEXT optional)
- Created db/init.ts database initialization script
- Added index on recorded_at for faster queries
- Created comprehensive tests for database schema
- Installed @types/better-sqlite3 for type checking
- Typecheck passes
- Tests pass (8/8 total, 5 new)

**Learnings:**
- better-sqlite3 is synchronous, which works well with Jest tests
- Need @types/better-sqlite3 for TypeScript support
- SQLite PRAGMA commands can verify table structure in tests
